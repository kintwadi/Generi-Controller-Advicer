# Generic-Controller-Advicer
You may probably know how painful is to write a robust REST API. 
Let's assume we want to create an error handler that will print application errors to the user. 
So this project aims to provide a generic exception handling for spring based REST services.
We will accomplish this task by using spring controller advicer concept. 
The main ideia is to map most frequent errors that can occur when developing REST applications.
We will use as reference the error codes listed in this link. https://httpstatuses.com/
